Technic Migrator
================

Use TechnicPack with 1.6+!
(based off of Forge installer)

Info
====

Please note that this is not finished, as I need to add support
for running minecraft directly from the launcher

To configure:
-------------

Edit "install_profile.json"
( see https://github.com/Atex/Migrator/commit/8fdb5631ad2a9a3a3c2397bd26d6453f201a4637#diff-7 for instructions on how to do this)

To use:
-------

compile the with guava and jdom (You might have to mess around with the libraries a little)
___________________
put the "lib" folder and modpack.jar from /dist/bin into a folder named "bin"
___________________
also put the jar you would like to be in you minecraft versions directory (usually this contains Forge, optifine, etc.) into the bin folder
___________________
put your bin folder into a zip file and uplnoad that to technicSolder
